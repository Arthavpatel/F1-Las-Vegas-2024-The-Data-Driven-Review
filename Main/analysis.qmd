# Reliability and performance of RB20

### Introduction
- In this section, I analyze the performance shortcomings of the RB20, which contributed to Red Bull Racing finishing third in the Constructors' Championship and failing to secure a championship title since 2021. Throughout the 2024 Formula 1 season, the RB20 was forced to retire from five races. In addition to these retirements, there were numerous driver complaints over team radio regarding performance related issues during Grand Prix events. These problems collectively hampered Red Bull’s ability to maintain competitiveness against rivals such as Mercedes and McLaren.

- Key Reasons for Underperformance of the RB20:
    - **Narrow Operating Window and Developmental Limitations**
        - According to Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko, one of the main issues was the car's narrow operational window, which restricted its adaptability and limited development opportunities. Technical director Pierre Waché elaborated that the most significant concern was a correlation discrepancy—data from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and the simulator did not match the actual on-track performance. This mismatch compromised setup strategies and development directions throughout the season.
    - **Neglected Design Elements**
        - Red Bull admitted to overlooking certain design elements that later proved to significantly influence performance. Although not deliberately excluded, the team acknowledged that they may not have given these elements enough attention during development. These oversights remained unresolved by the end of the season and have been prioritized for correction in the RB21 for 2025.
    - **Loss of Downforce**
        - The team also encountered unexpected downforce losses in specific areas of the car. Crucially, these issues were not apparent in wind tunnel testing, indicating a disconnect between aerodynamic modeling and real-world behavior—a serious concern in modern F1 design.
    - **Balance and Inertia to Change**
        - Early season dominance led Red Bull to adopt a conservative approach, refraining from major modifications to the RB20. However, once the European leg of the season began, McLaren and other teams closed the gap significantly. Waché admitted that the team was reluctant to alter the car's fundamental setup, and as rivals gained pace, it became clear that balance issues were one of RB20’s most limiting factors.
    - **Inability to Fully Unlock Potential**
        - According to Waché, the RB20 never reached its full performance potential. He noted that reverting to older specifications would not have improved results, underlining that the development path taken simply failed to deliver the expected gains.

# Reflection

- Analyzing the 2024 Spanish Grand Prix qualifying session allowed me to effectively harness my data science skills in a dynamic motorsport environment. Through an in-depth examination of car performance and telemetry data, I developed a robust understanding of the strategies and technical aspects at play, and I recognized just how crucial even the slightest error can be in affecting lap times.
- One of the most impactful insights from this project was the realization of how different driving styles significantly influence lap times. Lando Norris’s smooth throttle application, for instance, demonstrated a clear advantage on the track compared to other styles. By meticulously comparing the telemetry data of Lando Norris, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and Lewis Hamilton, I gained valuable insights into the interplay of mechanical grip, aerodynamic balance, and driver inputs in shaping sector performance. This experience not only sharpened my analytical abilities but also deepened my understanding of vehicle dynamics and setup optimization.
- Additionally, investigating the underperformance of the RB20 equipped me with vital insights into the challenges faced by elite racing teams. I thoroughly explored critical issues, including the correlation mismatch between simulation data and on-track performance, as well as aerodynamic flaws that contributed to the car's shortcomings.
- This project has fueled my passion for Formula 1 and data science, driving me to seek hands-on experience with a Formula 1 team where I am eager to contribute my skills and learn from the best in the industry.
