The new front wing provides improved stability, allowing for more consistent performance across different corner types.
- At the rear, the SF-23’s wing generated **excessive drag**, which negatively **impacted top speed and tire wear**. The SF-24 addresses this with a more efficient rear wing design, **reducing drag and improving straight-line speed**. This was particularly evident from **Turn 14 to Turn 1** at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, where the car demonstrated superior top speed and tire management.
- In high-speed corners, such as **Turn 3 and Turn 9**, the SF-24 showcased competitive performance, a testament to its enhanced aerodynamic efficiency. However, in low-speed corners like Turn 10 and Turn 14, the car exhibited **minor traction** issues, which slightly affected lap times.

### Power Unit
- The SF-24 retains the same power unit as the SF-23, the **066/10 hybrid power unit**. However, Ferrari has improved the **cooling efficiency** of the engine, allowing for better **thermal management** and sustained performance over longer stints. While the power output remains similar, the enhanced cooling system contributes to greater reliability and consistency during races.

### Tire Management
- During the race, Ferrari faced challenges related to **tire management**. The team struggled with pace and **tire degradation** possibly due to a **limited understanding** of the new updates introduced to the car. This suggests that while the SF-24 showed promise in qualifying, there were underlying issues affecting its performance consistency during **longer runs** in the race.

# Conclusion
- **Charles Leclerc** completed the lap in **1:11.731**, which was competitive and faster than most of the field. However, the SF-24 was unable to match the performance of cars like the **Red Bull RB20, McLaren MCL38, and Mercedes W15** during the qualifying session in Spanish Grand Prix. This underperformance in race conditions, particularly in long runs, highlights the need for further improvements in **tire management and race pace**.
